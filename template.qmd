```{julia}
using Revise                      # <1>
using RainwaterHarvesting         # <2>
```


### Setting the file path

```{julia}
filepath = "data/2.txt" # <1>   
rainfall_data = RainfallData(filepath) # <2>
rainfall_data.annual_data
```


### Plotting the Data

```{julia}
plot(rainfall_data) # <1>
```

### Discussion 
The years kept after data cleaning are 1985, 2004, 2002, 2001, 2013, 2015, 1991, 1976, 1988, and 2008. I believe that the available data is sufficient for meaningful risk assessments because the years span over a nearly 40-year period. 

### Discussion
The years that Ceara, Brazil had major droughts are 1998, 2002, 2012-2018. My data includes only some of these years  (2002, 2013, 2015.) Missing data during drought years can yield an inaccurate assessment, often an underestimation, of the impact of droughts on communities. This can lead to potential water shortages because water allocation strategies are based only on non-drought years. 

## Understanding the Theoretical Model

### Discussion
The major limiting assumption in the model is that all households will consume the same amount, beginning in the 150th day of the year. So I would create a household coefficient that would be the coefficient for consumption, which would be equivalent to the number of household members. This would however, also assume that one person consumes the same amount. Unfortunately, there is no way to quantify that. 
Thus, the modified equation would be
$$
V_{t+1}= V_t + Q_t -h*C_t | 0 \leq V_t \leq V_\text{max}
$$

## Model Implementation and Testing

### Defining the Model Parameters

```{julia}
#| output: false
param = ModelParameters(          # <1>
    runoff_coefficient=0.85,      # <2>
    roof_area_m2=40.0,            # <3>
    first_flush_mm=4.0,           # <4>
    tank_capacity_L=16000.0       # <5>
)
```

### Discussion
I decided to change roof area and first flush. Because many communities in Brazil will be lower-income, the roof areas will be smaller as houses will be smaller. I also increased first flush because it is more likely that the water will be dirtier, which means more water will need to be discarded. This will decrease the flow in of the mass balance equation, leading to the tank emptying much faster. 

### Running the Simulation for One Year

```{julia}
rainfall_1981 = rainfall_data.annual_data[1981]    # <1>
results_1981 = run_timesteps(rainfall_1981, param) # <2>
p1 = plot(results_1981)                                 # <3>
```

To compare rainfall and tank volume:

```{julia}
p2 = plot(rainfall_1981)
plot(p2, p1, layout=(2, 1), size=(1000, 700), link=:x)
```

### Reliability Analysis

```{julia}
all_years = sort(collect(keys(rainfall_data.annual_data)))          # <1>
all_results = [run_timesteps(rainfall_data.annual_data[year], param) for year in all_years]   # <2>
any_failures = [!isempty(result.failure_dates) for result in all_results]  # <3>
println("Number of years with failures: ", sum(any_failures), " out of ", length(all_years))  # <4>
```

### Discussion
The system failed for 10 years. This means the system has a reliability percentage of 80%. This shows that increasing the first flush and decreasing the roof area has a negative impact on the functionality of the system. Because it is unlikely that most people in Brazil will have enough money to increase their roof areas, it is necessary to implement standards of cleanliness in neighborhoods in order to keep the first flush under control. 

## Identify a Gap in the Methods
### Discussion
One assumption in the current model is that many drought years are not included. This underestimates the amount of years that will be failures because the flow in will actually be less than expected. In order to address this gap, data must be regularly collected every year and standardized. In doing so, we will achieve reliable data that we can then share to the public and implement water allocation measures for.
